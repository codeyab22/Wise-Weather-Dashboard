About:

My sixth project is making a weather dashboard to check the locations of cities and find out what the weather conditions for each day and hour. It is pretty 
complex, but simple. The user go to search name of location to find out about the forecast weather. Using the API key to make a call before a response, it is user-friendly
clear. 

User's Story

This person who don't watch the news like they used to. There are plenty of weather forecasts to search on online, but don't check to see what is going.  
This stunning layout makes the sun and moon rotate like the stars on the watch. I am looking for accurancy and would like to know what cities I am to have this 
weather.
