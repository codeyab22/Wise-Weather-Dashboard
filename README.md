About:

My sixth project is making a weather dashboard to check the locations of cities and find out what the weather conditions for each day and hour. It is pretty 
complex, but simple. The user go to search name of location to find out about the forecast weather. Using the API key to make a call before a response, it is user-friendly
clear.
